# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for a Text-to-SQL conversational chatbot that allows users to query product orders data using natural language. The system will leverage Amazon Bedrock LLM to convert natural language questions into SQL queries, execute them against a database, and return both human-readable answers and the executed SQL queries.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Natural Language Query Processing
**User Story:** As a business analyst, I want to ask questions about product orders in natural language, so that I can get insights without writing SQL queries.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN a user submits a natural language question about product orders THE SYSTEM SHALL convert it to a valid SQL query using Amazon Bedrock LLM
2. WHEN the natural language question is ambiguous THE SYSTEM SHALL provide clarification or make reasonable assumptions
3. WHEN the natural language question cannot be converted to SQL THE SYSTEM SHALL return an appropriate error message

### Requirement 2: SQL Query Execution
**User Story:** As a business analyst, I want the system to execute SQL queries against the product orders database, so that I can get real-time data insights.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN a valid SQL query is generated THE SYSTEM SHALL execute it against the product orders database
2. WHEN the SQL query execution fails THE SYSTEM SHALL return a meaningful error message
3. WHEN the SQL query returns results THE SYSTEM SHALL format them appropriately for display

### Requirement 3: Dual Response Format
**User Story:** As a business analyst, I want to see both the human-readable answer and the SQL query that was executed, so that I can understand how the system interpreted my question.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN a query is successfully executed THE SYSTEM SHALL return both a human-readable summary and the raw SQL query
2. WHEN displaying results THE SYSTEM SHALL format the human-readable answer in a conversational manner
3. WHEN showing the SQL query THE SYSTEM SHALL display it in a formatted, readable way

### Requirement 4: Product Orders Database
**User Story:** As a business analyst, I want to query a comprehensive product orders database, so that I can analyze sales patterns and trends.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN the system is deployed THE DATABASE SHALL contain sample product orders data with products, customers, orders, and order items
2. WHEN users ask about sales analytics THE DATABASE SHALL support queries for top-selling products, revenue trends, customer analytics, and time-based analysis
3. WHEN the database is queried THE SYSTEM SHALL handle common analytics questions like "most selling product in last month"

### Requirement 5: Conversational Interface
**User Story:** As a business analyst, I want a user-friendly chat interface, so that I can easily interact with the system and view query results.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN a user accesses the application THE SYSTEM SHALL display a clean chat interface
2. WHEN a user submits a question THE SYSTEM SHALL show the question in the chat history
3. WHEN the system responds THE SYSTEM SHALL display both the human-readable answer and SQL query in the chat
4. WHEN there are errors THE SYSTEM SHALL display them clearly in the chat interface

### Requirement 6: Sample Analytics Questions Support
**User Story:** As a business analyst, I want the system to handle common business analytics questions, so that I can get insights about sales performance.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN asked about top-selling products THE SYSTEM SHALL return products ranked by sales volume or revenue
2. WHEN asked about time-based trends THE SYSTEM SHALL support queries for different time periods (last month, quarter, year)
3. WHEN asked about customer analytics THE SYSTEM SHALL return insights about customer behavior and purchasing patterns
4. WHEN asked about revenue analysis THE SYSTEM SHALL provide financial metrics and comparisons
